  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>This system collects and stores TikTok access tokens and refresh tokens only after explicit user authorization via TikTok's OAuth2 flow. These tokens are securely stored in our backend (e.g., Supabase) and used solely for posting videos on behalf of the user.

We do not share, sell, or expose your personal data to third parties. Profile information such as username and avatar may be retrieved to confirm account linkage.

You may revoke access at any time via TikTok's account settings. Upon revocation, all tokens will be invalidated and removed from our system.

We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring secure handling of all data.</p>
